# FUSE.jl

FUSE (**FU**sion **S**ynthesis **E**ngine) is an open-source framework for integrated simulations of fusion devices.
Originally developed by General Atomics, FUSE is now publicly available under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://fuse.help/dev/notice.html).

The figure below is a sneakpeak of the models implemented in FUSE:

## Objectives

FUSE aims to achieve the following objectives:

* ⚡ Provide a highly efficient, modular framework that tightly couples models across different domains.
* 🧩 Integrate plasma physics, engineering, control, balance of plant, and costing systems.
* 🤖 Leverage machine learning to overcome the typical fidelity/speed tradeoff in simulations.
* ⏱️ Support both stationary and time-dependent simulations.
* 💻 Harness parallelism and high-performance computing (HPC) for large-scale studies.
* 🎯 Perform multi-objective constrained optimization to explore design tradeoffs.
* 🔍 Enable comprehensive sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification.

## Basic Concepts

FUSE is entirely written in Julia and is structured around the following core concepts:

1. **📂 Data storage**: All data is stored in the `dd` structure, which follows the ITER IMAS ontology.
2. **🧠 Actors**: The core components of FUSE simulations are physics and engineering actors.
3. **🕹️ Control**: Actor functionality is governed by `act` parameters.
4. **🚀 Initialization**: The data structure can be initialized from 0D `ini` parameters.
5. **🔧 Use cases**: FUSE includes templates for various machines (e.g., FPP, ITER, ARC).
6. **🔄 Studies**: Studies pre-bake commonly used functionalities, typically involving multiple FUSE simulations (eg. database generation or multi objective optimizations).
7. **🌍 Interoperability**: FUSE interfaces via `dd` with existing modeling tools like OMFIT/OMAS and the IMAS ecosystem.

## Usage Example

Here’s a simple example of setting up and running a FUSE simulation in Julia:

```julia
using FUSE

# Obtain `ini` and `act` parameters for a specific use case
ini, act = FUSE.case_parameters(:FPP)

# Initialize the `dd` structure from 0D `ini` parameters
dd = FUSE.init(ini, act)

# Run a stationary plasma actor simulation
FUSE.ActorStationaryPlasma(dd, act)

# Get an overview of the simulation results
FUSE.digest(dd)
```
