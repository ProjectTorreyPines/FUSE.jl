# Physics and Engineering Actors

Physics and engineering **actors** are the fundamental building blocks of FUSE simulations:
* Actors operate exclusively on `IMAS.dd` data
* Actors functionality is controlled via `act` parameters
* Actors can be combined into other actors

Fidelity hierarchy is enabled by concept of *generic* Vs *specific* actors
* Generic actors define physics/component 
* Specific actors implement a specific model for that physics/component
* For example:
  ```
  ActorEquilibrium  <--  generic
  ├─ ActorSolovev   <--  specific
  └─ ActorCHEASE    <--  specific
  ```
* `act.[ActorGeneric].model` selects specific actor being used
* All specific actors will expect data and fill the same enties in `dd`
  * IMAS.jl expressions are key to make this work seamlessly
* Where possible actors should make use of generic actors and not hardcode use of specific actors
