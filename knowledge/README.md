# FUSE Actor Knowledge Extractor

Simple Julia tool to extract structured knowledge from FUSE actors using Claude analysis.

## Overview

1. **JSON Schema** (`actor_schema.json`): Defines structure for actor analysis
2. **Simple Extractor** (`extract_knowledge.jl`): Walks actors/ folder, uses Claude to analyze each file
3. **Individual JSONs**: Creates `actors/SOMETHING_actor.json` mirroring source structure  
4. **Combined Knowledge Base**: Single `fuse_knowledge_base.json` with all actors

## Usage

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")

include("extract_knowledge.jl")

# Parallel extraction (recommended - ~6x faster)
kb = extract_fuse_knowledge_parallel()

# Sequential extraction
kb = extract_fuse_knowledge()

# Test with a few actors
test_extraction()
```

## Output Structure

```
knowledge/
├── actor_schema.json           # JSON schema definition
├── fuse_knowledge_base.json    # Combined knowledge base (see below)
└── actors/                     # Individual actor JSONs
    ├── equilibrium/
    │   └── stationary_actor.json
    ├── transport/
    │   └── transport_actor.json
    └── ...
```

### Individual vs Combined Files

**Individual Actor JSONs** (`actors/category/actor_name.json`):
- **Use for**: Focused queries about specific actors
- **Contains**: Detailed actor analysis per schema
- **Benefits**: Easy to update incrementally, mirrors source structure
- **Perfect for**: Development, specific actor documentation

**Combined Knowledge Base** (`fuse_knowledge_base.json`):
- **Use for**: Global queries, MCP server loading, system overview
- **Contains**: All individual actors PLUS:
  - Global metadata and statistics
  - Category-to-actors mappings  
  - Hierarchy classifications (single vs compound)
  - Cross-actor relationships
- **Benefits**: Single file load, fast category queries, system-wide analysis
- **Perfect for**: MCP servers, global search, system architecture overview

## Schema

Each actor JSON contains:
- `name`: Actor class name
- `category`: Domain (equilibrium, transport, etc.) 
- `hierarchy`: "single" or "compound"
- `description`: What the actor does
- `physics_domain`: Physics/engineering domain
- `data_inputs`/`data_outputs`: IMAS data paths
- `sub_actors`: For compound actors (empty for single)
- `key_parameters`: Important parameters
- `usage_notes`: Warnings, best practices

## Requirements

- Julia with JSON package
- Claude Code CLI (`claude` command available)
- FUSE source code at `../src/actors/`

## How It Works

1. Finds all `*_actor.jl` files in `../src/actors/`
2. **Parallel Processing**: Processes actors in batches (8 concurrent Claude requests)
3. For each file: asks Claude to analyze and return JSON per schema
4. Saves individual JSON files mirroring directory structure
5. Combines all into final knowledge base with additional metadata

## Performance

- **Sequential**: ~30+ minutes for 60 actors
- **Parallel (batch_size=8)**: ~3-4 minutes for 60 actors 
- **~8x speed improvement** through batched parallel processing
- Uses Julia threading for concurrent Claude API calls

## Error Handling

The system is designed to be robust against Claude API failures:

1. **Retry Logic**: Each actor gets 1 automatic retry if Claude analysis fails
2. **Individual File Preservation**: Even if Claude fails, any successfully created individual JSONs are preserved
3. **Automatic Recovery**: After extraction, missing actors are automatically recovered from individual files
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues processing other actors even if some fail

**Example**: If 2 actors fail Claude analysis but their individual JSONs exist, the system will:
- Complete extraction of remaining 58 actors
- Automatically detect and recover the 2 missing actors from individual files  
- Rebuild relationships with the complete 60-actor dataset
- Report final success: "🔧 Recovered 2 actors from individual files"

## Handling Moved/Deleted Source Files

The system also handles cases where source files are moved, renamed, or deleted:

**Detection**: Automatically identifies orphaned JSON files (individual JSONs without corresponding source files)
```julia
# Check for orphaned files
orphaned = check_orphaned_fuse_actors()

# Clean up orphaned files (with confirmation)
clean_orphaned_fuse_actors()
```

**During extraction**: Reports orphaned files but keeps them in the knowledge base
```
⚠️ Found 2 orphaned actor files (source deleted/moved): ActorOldFeature, ActorDeprecated
```

**Workflow**: 
1. Detects orphaned files during extraction
2. Includes them in knowledge base (they still contain valuable information)
3. Reports them for manual review
4. Provides cleanup tools for maintenance

Simple, fast, and reliable! 🎯
