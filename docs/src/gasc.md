# GA Systems Code

FUSE simulations can be initialized from the results of GASC simulations.

This is done in two steps:
1. The GASC simulation is first loaded as a `FUSE.GASC` data structure
2. The `FUSE.GASC` structure is converted into `ini` and `act` parameters, which can then fed to FUSE actors/workflows as usual

This is accomplished this way:
```julia
gasc = FUSE.GASC("gasc_file.json", gasc_simulation_number)
ini, act = case_parameters(gasc)
```

!!! note "To be read by FUSE the GASC Python pickle output files need to first converted to Json format"
    ```python
    filename = "path_to_the_gasc_output.pkl"
    casename = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(filename))[1]
    json = OMFITjson(casename + ".json", objects_encode=False)
    json.update(OMFITpickle(filename))
    json.deploy()
    ```
