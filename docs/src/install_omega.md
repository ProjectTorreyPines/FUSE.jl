# Users: Public FUSE installation on GA's Omega

If you only intend to use FUSE and don't plan to develop the source code, release versions of FUSE
have been installed on the Omega cluster. To load the latest version, do
```
module load fuse
```
All available versions can be found with `module avail fuse`.

These modules do several things to make running FUSE easier for Omega users:

1. The `julia` module is loaded, which gives you access to a public Julia installation with your
   own private "depot" in which each user can add or develop their own packages. The location
   of this private depot is given by the environment variable `JULIA_USER_DEPOT`.

1. The FUSE codebase has been precompiled and made available to Julia via a
   [sysimage](https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl/dev/sysimages.html).
   This greatly reduces the time-to-first-execution (TTFX) for many functions in the FUSE code suite,
   at the expense of "locking" those packages and functions to the versions with which they
   were compiled.

1. FUSE is already available when you launch Julia, so there's no need to do `Pkg.add("FUSE")`.
   You can simply do `using FUSE` and being working.

1. A custom conda installation is made available to you that has Jupyter notebooks with
   precompiled Julia kernels that include the FUSE sysimage. You can just do `jupyter lab` to
   start a Jupyter session and select the desired kernels. There is a kernel with 10 threads meant
   for the login nodes and one with 40 threads meant for the worker nodes.
   !!! warning
       **Problem**: There's a bug that occurs when a new user first launches one of these
       Julia + FUSE Jupyter kernels.
       In your terminal, you will see output about precompiling IJulia, which is expected.
       Once the precompilation is done, it will report `Starting kernel event loops` but then the
       kernel may hang and your notebook may not work. It is unclear why this happens, but it is
       only the first time for each user.

       **Solution**: Restart the kernel. Occasionally this needs to be done twice, perhaps if you
       restart too quickly and the precompilation was not finished. In any case, if the problem
       does not resolve after restarting the kernel twice, reach out to the FUSE developers.


# Developing FUSE on GA's Omega cluster

## Setting up Jupyter Notebooks

!!! note
    Omega does have a system version of conda (available via `module load conda`) and one can create
    a custom environment as described in the
    [Omega documentation](http://mkdocs.gat.com/Software_On_Omega/Conda/), but this
    has not been tested yet. Two important caveats if one wants to try this:
    - The `conda` module should be loaded _after_ the `julia` module, as `julia` purges all other
      modules, as discussed below.
    - The `conda` module requires use of the bash shell. No other shell is supported.

The following is a robust setup to make Jupyter notebooks compatible with Julia on Omega:

1. Install miniconda
   ```
   cd # in your home folder
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```
   read and accept the license, and install under `$HOME/miniconda3`, answer questions, and restart
   your shell.

1. Install `mamba` for faster package management
   ```
   $HOME/miniconda3/bin/conda install -c conda-forge mamba
   ```
   !!! note
       We use the full `conda` path to avoid picking up the system `conda` install. There is no system-wide `mamba` executable, so that's not necessary when running `mamba`.

1. Install `jupyterlab`
   ```
   mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
   ```

1. Load the Julia module with
   ```
   module load julia
   ```
   This gives you access to a public Julia
   installation with your own private "depot" in which each user can add or develop their own
   packages. The location of this private depot is given by the environment variable
   `JULIA_USER_DEPOT`.
   !!! warning
       Julia is incompatible with some modules loaded by the `defaults` module, which typically
       comes pre-loaded on Omega and is used to run experimental tools like review+, efit_viewer,
       etc.... The `julia` module automatically purges your modules to prevent this conflict.
       If you do use your own installation of Julia, you'll want to do a `module purge` yourself
       or remove `module load defaults` from your `~/.bashrc` file.

1. Follow the instructions under the [Install FUSE](https://fuse.help/dev/install.html) page,
   ignoring the sections about _Julia installation_ and _Updating Julia_.

1. Setup a multi-threaded Jupyter Julia kernel that does not take the whole login node
   ```
   export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=10
   fusebot install_IJulia

   export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=40
   fusebot install_IJulia
   ```
   Omega login nodes are a shared resource. Each login node has 40 cores.
   This will setup a Jupyter Julia kernel with both 10 and 40 threads.
   Use 10 threads on login nodes and 40 threads on worker nodes.

## Distributed.jl on Omega

We have found issues when trying to run parallel jobs using `Distributed.jl` on Omega.
The fix for this is simple: don't use the `Main` environment, rather activate a separate environment.

This can be easily by doing the following in the first cell of your Jupyter notebook:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate("$HOME/julia_runs/my_run") # this is key, to avoid using the Main FUSE environment
Pkg.add(("Plots", "FUSE"))
```

## Three ways to run parallel jobs

Keep in mind that each worker node on Omega has 128 CPUs

1. Screen + Jupyter on the login node, workers on the worker nodes

   OK when the master process will not be doing a lot of work, and we need multiple nodes

   Here we will use the `FUSE.parallel_environment("omega", ...)` call.

1. Screen on the login node, Jupyter and workers on one worker node

   OK when the master process will be doing a lot of work, and we don't need more than one node

   Here we will use the `FUSE.parallel_environment("localhost", ...)` call.

1. Screen on the login node, Jupyter on a worker node, workers on different worker nodes

   OK when the master process will be doing a lot of work, and we need multiple nodes

   This is more complex, and finicky. Avoid if possible.

   Here we will use the `FUSE.parallel_environment("omega", ...)` call.


## FUSE on Omega cluster

1. Connect to `omega` and launch `screen`

   !!! note
       You can re-connect to an existing `screen` session with `screen -r`

1. **If (and only if) you want to run Jupyter on a worker node** do as follows:

    `srun --partition=ga-ird --nodes=1 --time=4-00:00:00 --pty bash -l`

   !!! note
       Use the queue, time, CPU, and memory limits that make the most sense for your application
       see these [instructions](https://fusionga.sharepoint.com/sites/Computing/SitePages/Omega.aspx#using-slurm-to-run-interactive-tasks%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B) for help

1. Then start the Jupyter lab server from the `screen` session (`screen` will keep `jupyter`
   running even when you log out)
   ```
   jupyter lab --no-browser --port 55667
   ```

   Copy the token that you see on this session it should look something like ```token=1f1e0259cbc1..................```

1. On your computer setup your `~/.ssh/config` this way (need to do this only once):
   ```
   Host cybele cybele.gat.com
   Hostname cybele.gat.com
   User meneghini
   Port 2039

   Host omegae omega.gat.com
   Hostname omega.gat.com
   User meneghini
   ProxyCommand ssh -q cybele nc %h %p

   # change XX to the worker node number you've been assigned to
   Host omegaXX omegaXX.gat.com
   Hostname omegaXX.gat.com
   User meneghini
   ProxyCommand ssh -q cybele nc %h %p
   ```

1. On your computer start a tunnel going through `cybele` to `omega`
   ```
   ssh -N -L localhost:33445:localhost:55667 omegae
   ```
   !!! note
       Keep this terminal always open. You may need to re-issue this command whenever you put your
       laptop to sleep.

1. On your computer open a web browser tab to `localhost:33445` to connect to the Jupyter-lab
   session on `omega`. Use the token when prompted.

## Using Revise on Omega
When working on omega it seems ones need to manually trigger revise to pick up code changes:
```
import Revise
Revise.revise()  # manual trigger
```

This is even if setting [`JULIA_REVISE_POLL=1`](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/config/#Polling-and-NFS-mounted-code-directories:-JULIA_REVISE_POLL)

## Using GACODE on Omega with Julia
Julia may be incompatible with some environments and will crash when launched.
This is the case for the GACODE environment on Omega.
To be able to run both GACODE and Julia on Omega (eg. to run NEO and TGLF) do the following:
```
module load atom
module unload gcc
module unload env
```
