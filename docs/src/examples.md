# Worked examples

[FUSE Jupyter examples](https://github.com/ProjectTorreyPines/FuseExamples) are available and can be cloned to the current working directory with:

```bash
fusebot install_examples
```

To see/run those `.ipynb` files, you'll need to use [Jupyter-Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) or [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
