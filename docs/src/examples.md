# Worked examples

[FUSE Jupyter examples](https://github.com/ProjectTorreyPines/FUSE_examples) are available and can be cloned to the current working directory with:

   ``bash
   ptp FUSE_examples
   ```

To see/run those `.ipynb` files, you'll need to use [Jupyter-Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) or VScode.
